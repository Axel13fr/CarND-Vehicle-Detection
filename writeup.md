**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is located in the `feature_extraction.py` (in lines 86 through 96).  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

![alt text][image1]

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

My conclusion on this experiment was that RGB color space didn't add a lot of information between R, G and B channels, which is not suprising as this color space doesn't seperate well chroma from lumina or saturation unlike HSV or YUV. 

![HOG output][hog]

Some other channels will show different features which might be useful for later classification, as demosntrated here in an example using the `YUV` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=6`, `pixels_per_cell=(12, 12)` and `cells_per_block=(1, 1)`:

![HOG output][hog_yuv]

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and my final choice was driven by the classifier performance when training it on HOG features alone. Here are my statistics for the different channels and then combined:
- HSV : 0 gives 0.93, 1 gives 0.88, 2 gives 0.94, ALL gives 0,97
- YUV : 0 gives 0.94, 1 gives 0.94, 2 gives 0.90, ALL gives 0,98
- YU from YUV: 0.97
I applied the same idea to find out the influence of other parameters, for example:  
- orient = 6 # 9 gives 0.93, 6 gives 0.92
- pix_per_cell = 12 # 8 gives 0,93, 10 gives 0.92, 12 gives 0.92
- cell_per_block: 1 gives 0.93, 2 gives 0.94

In the end, my goal was to have a feature vector as small as possible (runs faster, trains faster, less prone to overfit...) so I decided to use parameters which would minimize it without impacting performance too much. So for example orientation and cell_per_block could be reduced with minimal performance loss while greatly reducing the feature vector size as shown by the statistics above.
I used the same trick when selecting only Y and U channels instead of all as the difference when using YUV is less than 1%.

So my final parameters were: `orientations=6`, `pixels_per_cell=(12, 12)`, `cells_per_block=(1, 1)` applied on Y and U Channels


#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

My training vectors are generated by the generate_features() function located in `train.py` : it reads in all car and not car images and generates feature vectors made of spatial, color and hog features. Each vector is made of about 1000 elements and is then stored in a pickle file for reuse in training as well as all the settings used to generate this features. These are needed to apply the same process to an input image and transform it for the classifier. Saving the feature vectors also allows to quickly recover the Standard Scaler and apply it to new inputs for proper normalization (see combine_normalize in `feature_extraction.py`.

I trained a linear SVC using the Model class defined in the `train.py`. I used a gridsearch over the C parameter to find the best result. The trained model is saved at the send of the training and can be loaded for reuse without training again. 

Instead of a simple traning split, I used a [Stratified shuffle](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html#sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit) split which does 5 splits of the data, uses one split as test set and the 4 other as training set and then rotates, while making sure that there is about the same number of positive and negative examples. This was used as a strategy to reduce overfitting.

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

Slidding window search was done by mostly reusing code from the lessons, slightly tuned for my own needs. This is done in the find_cars() function in `pipeline.py`. It basically defines an area where to slide the windows (y start and stop) to avoid searching outside the ROI and make sure that the windows are centered (x start) horizontally if some space was left unsearched on 
the sides due to the window size.

The search is done on 64x64 windows which corresponds to a scale of 1. When the scale is changed to a higher value, the image size is reduced by that scale, making the window size effectively bigger relative to the image, which allows an easy control of the window size.

I first tried to select 3 different sizes of slidding windows and apply them to the most relevant areas (smaller sizes near the middle, bigger sizes closer to the ego car). I then did many trials to accomated 2 contraints:
- minimze the number of windows sizes usedand the overlapping and reduce the ROI --> smaller runtime
- balance these parameters with the need to have enough hot boxes to gain confidence that a real car was detected to be able to filter out false alarms later

In the end, I converged onto using 2 different slidding window sizes (82pix & 96pix) with an overlapping of 75%:

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Most importantly, I first trained my SVC on one type of feature alone to see how good it could perform and how much I could reduce to minimize the feature vector size without impacting performance. See above for an explanation on the HOG features parameters in details.

Using this strategy, while training on color histogram feature alone, I found out that YUV was not as good as the HSV performance so I decided to build my color histogram on 30 bins using HSV color space specifically. This color classification could get me over 85% alone.

When combined with spatial features (15 by 15 down scaling) and hog features, my classifier got a 99% score after a 5-fold split training, trained on provided vehicle and not vehicles dataset of the project without any augmentation (about 17000 samples). 

I also played a lot with the slidding window sizes and overlapping and optimized these to make sure I would get enough detections to filter out false positive aggressively.

Here are a few example of the raw dections running 2 slidding window sizes:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_output.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video and saved them into a FIFO with a fixed size of 8: it will accumulate all detections from the last 8 frames (see filter_detections() in the `pipeline.py` file).

From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions: a threshold of 6 detections was applied so 6 detections are required over the last 8 frames with each frame contributing very often to more than one detection per vehicle because of the 2 different slidding window sizes and the 75% overlapping.

I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected as seen in the filter_detections() function. For the sake of illustration, the same frame was run 3 times in a raw for each of the example below to generate bounding boxes and go accross false detection threshold.

### Here are 2 frames, their corresponding heatmaps and the bounding box results:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  

There are several things to consider to generalize this approach and make it work for more cases:
- SVM side:
* use more training data to make it more robust (I only used the kit provided with the project, not even udacity data)
* apply another data split pattern to cope with time series and avoid overfit on these [TimeSeriesSplit for example](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html#sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit)
* use data augmentation to produce more samples without new data (resize, minor rotation, flip...)

- Slidding windows & False positives filtering:
* the approach taken here has been strongly optimized for the project video to show no false positives and nearby cars at all frames, this will most likely fail in other videos 
* use a statistical validation of the whole pipeline to truly measure the performances on hours of video --> this shall help choosing parameters (basically applying a grid search method on several hours of labeled videos to derive KPIs for each parameter combination and choose the best !)
* The heatmap approach could be improved by using the output probability of the SVM and add a count depending on it instead of always adding +1 (more trust in detection = more contribution to heatmap)

In general, this approach is not sufficient by itself to really act on vehicle information as it is too sensible to other problems such as bad weather, low light or dirty camera lens. It has to be confirmed by other kind of sensors together to have a reliable system, basically applying sensor fusion :=)
